# David McLaren's dotfiles
This is how I like things setup. I primarily use this on a macOS system but this could be and should be adapted to work on Linux or even Windows with WSL. This will always be a work in progress.


### How to Use:
Open up terminal, clone this repository to your root folder, and then run the `setup.sh` file inside the dotfiles folder.

```sh
sh ~/dotfiles/setup.sh
```

You will need to enter in your password once and from there everything should be installed.
